The linker simply performs a string overlap search on named entities, comparing them with a knowledge base of 2.7 million concepts using an approximate nearest neighbours search.\n",

For instance, *'rRNA'* and *'ribosomal RNA'* both refer to the UMLS concept 'C0035701', i.e. *Ribosomal ribonucleic acid*. As mentioned in the quote above, name ambiguity is not fully handled but let's hope that biomedical entities are less ambigue compared to person names (e.g. *John Smith*). \n",
